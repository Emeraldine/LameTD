# Ideas:

Some sort of tower defense game
  
  We would have to code things like 
  
  ## Required
  - a money system 
  - enemies 
  - Towers 
  - maps/pathing for enemies
  - Rounds/Waves
  
  ## Extra
  - Upgrading Towers
  - Multiple Maps
  - Main Menu
  - Sending Enemies to yourself
  - Stream Mode (Continous, no waves)


  We need sprites/art for it, doesn't have to be good but it should~~n't~~ just be colorful rectangles

  Add ideas as you think of them.
