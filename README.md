# LameTD

# What works:

Not much tbh

Rounds work, shooting kinda works, its an insta kill no matter what tho

Better towers have bigger radius and faster attack rate, so spiffy

it doesnt look like it works, but thats cuz of canvas refresh rate, i swear it does(kinda)

other than than, buying towers, spawning enemies, etc work, basically, its just a shitty tower defense

# Ideas:

Some sort of tower defense game
  
  We would have to code things like 
  
  ## Required
  - a money system 
  - enemies 
  - Towers 
  - maps/pathing for enemies
  - Rounds/Waves
  
  ## Extra
  - Upgrading Towers
  - Multiple Maps
  - Main Menu
  - Sending Enemies to yourself
  - Stream Mode (Continous, no waves)


  We need sprites/art for it, doesn't have to be good but it should~~n't~~ just be colorful rectangles

  Add ideas as you think of them.
